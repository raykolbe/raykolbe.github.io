Oh geez, you're reading my about page. Who reads these pages anyways? I suppose you do! Hooray!
Well then. My name is Ray and I currently reside in the DC Metro area in the US.
Solving important real world problems using technology is what I love to do.

Given that you made it this far you probably want to know even more about me. You
can reach out and/or follow me through:
